# devenv

A base repository for Nexus developers.

## Setting up Docker

We have created a Docker image to make it easier to get started working on Nexus
code. You can found out more about it at
[ryepdx/devenv-docker](https://github.com/ryepdx/devenv-docker). (This will
eventually be moved to NexusDevelopment/devenv-docker.)
